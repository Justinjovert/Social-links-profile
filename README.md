### Links

- Live Site URL: [Github](https://justinjovert.github.io/Social-links-profile)

## My process

 A container for the whole content and have its direction set to column and adjust each element's padding and margin.

 Used anchor tag instead of button, more simpler that way!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### Continued development

Continue to do challenges to solidify skills.
